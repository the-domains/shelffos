In The Back
![Camera maker Lytro drew our attention three years ago with what it called "light field" photography. Instead of focusing at a specific depth, its camera would capture everything in range of its finder, so you could do things like pick a focus after taking the picture.](https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/036fb63a54482b2cdbc4936adc400d5f/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=2593&cropwidth=3872&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5a6ce7eb-cb78-41a6-b288-97b9204c6333.jpg&x=0&y=0)
