  A brainchild of local hotelier Raniero Campigotto, Starlight Room Dolomites is
  a mobile glass-encased bedroom tucked away in the picturesque Italian Alps, 20
  km from the swanky ski resort of Cortina d'Ampezzo. Perched at an altitude of
  2,055 meters, the secluded cabin rewards those who brave the climb up with
  marvelous mountain views by day and pollution-free starry skies by night.

![The Appalachian trail crosses these tracks and going north crosses through a cow pasture and then up some serious hills. Going south it is a bit flatter for a while until you get into Stokes State Forest where your climb is rewarded by a top of the ridge view of some Sussex county lakes.](https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f15088aecd9fda7e0e6d5ee18645da6c/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=2593&cropwidth=3872&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F2bb81dd1-5b28-4478-9edc-98bf69dfb82d.jpg&x=0&y=0)
